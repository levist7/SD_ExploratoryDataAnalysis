## Project üöß   

The goal is to try to understand üíò! Being a very complicated subject, we will try to understand what happens during a speed dating and what are the parameters influencing to have a second date. This is a Kaggle competition with more details on Kaggle.

**Speed Dating Dataset**

It is neccessary to the description of the challenge and try to understand each of the variables in the dataset.

During the speed dating events, the attendees had a four minute "first date" with each participant of the opposite sex. Participants were then asked if they were up to seeing their speed date second time. They also rated their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests. The dataset also includes demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information.  

The dataset also consists of questionnaires gathered from speed dating participants.

Note: Original data was compiled  from 2002-04 by professors of Columbia Business School: Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper Gender Differences in Mate Selection - Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment. Link to the article:  https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.2006.121.2.67

## Deliverables  

Availabe deliverables üì¨:  

1- An exploratory data analysis notebook on key factors influence a second appointment. The questions that were tried to be answered are listed below: 

*  What is the demographics of women and men attending speed dating events? Are there any common background information in terms of race, income, city, age, etc.?  
* Which personal traits and histories make a candidate more succesful in a dating event? Any gender specific findings?  
* What are the most desirable attributes in speed-dating participants? What are the least ones?  
* Do certain free time activities help getting participants a date?
